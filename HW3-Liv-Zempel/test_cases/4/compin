Here's a short song about the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression algorithm written by ChatGPT:

Verse 1:
I love LZW compression, it's so much fun
I use it every day, it helps me get things done
I've got dictionaries and codes, bits and bytes
Compression ratios, oh my, it's such a sight

Chorus:
Oh LZW compression, you make my data so small
You help me save space and transmit it all
I can't imagine computing without you
LZW compression, I love you too

Verse 2:
I've got strings and patterns to encode and decode
LZW's the best, it's not just a code
Text and images, it handles with ease
LZW compression, you never cease

Chorus:
Oh LZW compression, you make my data so small
You help me save space and transmit it all
I can't imagine computing without you
LZW compression, I love you too
