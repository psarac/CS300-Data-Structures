Here's a data structures version of the song "Gangsta's Paradise":

As I walk through the data structures of life
I take a look at my storage and realize
There's arrays and linked lists, queues and stacks
Trees and graphs, oh my, there's no turning back
I've been spending most of my career
Just trying to learn and grow
But the data structures never seem to cease
I'm living in a data structures paradise

Verse 1:
Struggling to understand these concepts
Searching, inserting, deleting, every day
I've got to keep pushing, moving on
I can't let these data structures get me gone
Search algorithms and sorting too
I've got to learn them all, there's so much to do
But I keep working hard, I won't give up
I'll master these data structures, I won't be stuck

Chorus:
I'm living in a data structures paradise
I've got to keep learning, I can't compromise
I'll keep working hard, I'll never give up
I'll master these data structures, I won't get stuck
I'm living in a data structures paradise

Verse 2:
I've got stacks for my function calls
Queues for my messages, I won't stall
I've got trees for my hierarchical data
And graphs for my relationships, I won't be mad
I'll keep pushing forward, I won't retreat
I'll master these data structures, I can't be beat
I'll keep learning and growing, every day
I'm living in a data structures paradise, hooray!

Chorus:
I'm living in a data structures paradise
I've got to keep learning, I can't compromise
I'll keep working hard, I'll never give up
I'll master these data structures, I won't get stuck
I'm living in a data structures paradise
