Cosmic latte is the name given to the average color of the universe. It was determined by a team of astronomers who used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to measure the colors of nearly one million galaxies and quasars. They found that the average color of the universe is a pale, off-white color that has been described as "cosmic latte."

The color of cosmic latte is thought to be the result of the combined light of all the stars and galaxies in the universe. The light from these celestial objects is made up of a wide range of colors, and when it is all combined, it produces a pale, off-white hue.

The term "cosmic latte" was coined by the astronomer Carl J. Grillmair, who was part of the team that determined the average color of the universe. The name was chosen as a playful reference to the popular coffee drink "latte," which is made with espresso and steamed milk and has a pale, off-white color.
